        <h2>DNA - THE CODE OF LIFE</h2>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>All living organisms contains both DNA (deoxyrebonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).</p>
        <p>In this book we will focus on their:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Location</li>
            <li> Structure </li>
            <li> Function </li>
            <li> Discovery of DNA, its role in the human body and how it replicates.</li>
            <li> Protein synthesis is vital for life, how proteins are formed by both DNA and RNA.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Revision of cellular structure from grade 10.</h4>
        <p> it is important to know the location and functions of certain organelles, illustrated in 
        <b>Figure 1</b> below.</p>

        <p><b>Cytoplasm</b> is the base substance in which the organelles of the cell are 
        suspended. It is a watery substance and allows for metabolic reactions to take place.</p>
        <p><b>Ribosomes</b> are small, round organelles which are mainly found attached to the 
        endoplasmic reticulum or are free-floating in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes can also be 
        found inside other organelles such as the chloroplast and mitochondria but in smaller 
        numbers. They are the site of protein synthesis and consist of RNA and protein.</p>
        <p>The nucleus controls all of the cell’s activities. </p>

        </div>

        <P>A nuclus has four main parts:</P>
        <ul>
            <li>the double <b>nuclear membrane</b> – it encloses the nucleus and contains small 
            pores to allow for the passage of substances in and out of the nucleus</li>
            <li>the <b>nucleoplasm</b> – this is a jelly-like fluid within the nucleus</li>
            <li> the <b>nucleolus</b> – a dark body suspended in the nucleoplasm which contains 
            free nucleotide bases and produces ribosomes</li>
            <li>the <b>chromatin network</b> – found in the nucleoplasm: contains the DNA which 
            forms the chromosomes containing the genetic code of a person / organism</li>
        </ul>
        <!--<h6>By now you should know the location of DNA and RNA. Where are they located? discuss this with your mates.</h6>-->
        <h4>The structure of Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA)</h4>
        <p>There are two types of nucleic acids in the human body:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DNA - deoxyrebonucleic acid</li>
            <li>RNA - ribonucleic acid</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Together these forms the basis of of all life of earth.</p>
        <P>They consist of monomers (bulding blocks) called nuleotides.</P>
        <p>The basic structure  of a nuleotide is illustrated in <b>Figure 3</b> below.</p>
        <p>Each nucleic acid is composed of a <b>phosphate (P)</b>, a <b>sugar molecule (S)</b> and a <b>nitrogenous base (NB)</b>.</p>

        <h4>A brief history of the discovery of DNA </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>1952</b> – <b>Rosalind Franklin</b> and her assistant <b>Maurice Wilkins</b> researched the 
            structure of DNA using X-ray diffraction images.</li>
            <li> <b>Watson and Crick</b> did independent research on DNA. Upon seeing Franklin’s 
            images, they proposed a 3-D double helix model for DNA in <b>1953.</b></li>
            <li> <b>1962 – Watson and Crick</b> received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the 
            structure of DNA, and <b>Wilkins</b> received an award for his X-ray photography.
            <b>Franklin had died of cancer.</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The location of DNA</h4>
        <p>DNA is found in two locations in a cell:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mostly in the nucleus of a cell - this is referred to as <b>nuclear DNA.</b></li>
            <li>a small amount is found outside the nucleus - it is referred to as <b>extra-nuclear DNA.</b></li>
            <p>There are two types of <b>extra-nuclear DNA</b>:</p>
            <ul>
            <div class = "unshade">
                <li><b>Chloroplastic DNA</b> - found in the chloroplasts of plant cells.</li>
                <li><b>Mitochondrial DNA</b> found in the mitochondria (useful for tracing ancestry).</li>

            <p><b>DNA has a double helix structure (Figure 4A), consisting of monomers called 
            nucleotides</b> which link to form long chains, called <b>polymers</b>. The sugar in DNA is 
            <b>deoxyribose sugar</b> and is attached to a <b>nitrogenous base</b>. The <b>phosphate and sugar 
            molecules</b> are attached to one another by strong bonds alternately to form the long 
            chains (Figure 4B).</p>
            <p>There are four types of <b>nitrogenous bases in DNA:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>adenine (A)</li>
                <li>thymine (T)</li>
                <li>cytosine (C)</li>
                <li>guanine (G)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Nitrogenous bases are complementary</b>, and always join together in a specific order:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b style="background-color: aqua;">adenine</b> always links to <b style="background-color: aquamarine;">thymine</b></li>
                <li><b style="background-color: cornflowerblue;">guanine</b> always links with <b style="background-color: khaki;">cytosine</b></li>
                <p>Alternately</p>
                <li><b>A - T</b></li>
                <li><b>G - C</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>This pairing of bases means that two strands of DNA are joined together, forming a 
            long ladder-like structure. <b>The nitrogenous bases are held together by</b> <b style="color: red;">weak 
            hydrogen bonds.</b> The ladder-like structure becomes coiled and is known as a <b>double 
            helix structure.</b> The DNA strands wind around proteins which are known as 
            <b>histones.</b></p>
            
            <h4>The role of DNA</h4>
            <p>DNA carries hereditary information in the form of genes. Genes are short sections of 
            DNA which code for a specific trait, and determine the physical characteristics (e.g. 
            blood grouping, a gene linked to breast cancer) and behaviour of an organism (e.g. 
            whether an organism can be tamed and domesticated). </p>
            <p>Most of the DNA strands do not code for anything and are known as non-coding 
            DNA. Scientists are still researching the importance of the non-coding DNA.</p>

            <p>The main functions of DNA include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Controls the functioning of cells</li>
                <li> Regulate the functioning of genes</li>
                <li> Passes on hereditary characteristics</li>
            </ul>
